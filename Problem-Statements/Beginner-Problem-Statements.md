## Overview

The Beginner Level problems are designed to introduce participants to core cloud and deployment concepts.  
These problem statements focus on understanding how applications and websites are hosted, deployed, and accessed in a cloud environment using practical, real-world scenarios.

## Problem 1: Deploy a Static Website on AWS

### Problem Statement  
Students are required to create and deploy a static website on the cloud.

### Brief Description  
A static website contains only frontend components such as text, images, styling, and basic interactivity, without any backend processing or database.  
The website may represent a college club page, personal portfolio, event page, or any informational site.  
The main objective is to help participants understand how websites can be hosted on the cloud without relying on traditional servers.

## Problem 2: Simple Web Application Deployment on EC2

### Problem Statement  
Students must deploy a basic backend-based web application on a cloud-hosted virtual machine.

### Brief Description  
The application should first be executed on a local system and then deployed on a remote server in the cloud.  
This problem focuses on understanding virtual machines, server environments, and manual deployment processes, highlighting the differences between local and cloud execution.

## Problem 3: Cloud-Based File Upload System

### Problem Statement  
Students are required to build a web application that allows users to upload files and store them securely on the cloud.

### Brief Description  
Uploaded files should be stored in cloud storage instead of the server’s local file system.  
This problem represents real-world use cases such as assignment submissions, document storage, or image uploads, and focuses on how applications interact with cloud storage securely.

## Problem 4: Dockerized Web Application on AWS

### Problem Statement  
Students must containerize a web application and deploy it on a cloud server.

### Brief Description  
The application and its dependencies should be packaged together to ensure consistent execution across environments.  
This problem introduces container-based deployment and demonstrates how containerization improves portability and reliability.

---

## Problem 5: CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions

### Problem Statement  
Students must automate the deployment process of an application using a CI/CD pipeline.

### Brief Description  
The focus is on understanding how application updates can be deployed automatically when changes are made to the codebase.  
Participants should demonstrate version control usage and explain how automation improves development workflows.
